# **Digitally Generated Music In MATLAB**

This project generates music digitally using sine waves to create piano notes. The code recreates the chorus of **Adventure of a Lifetime** by Coldplay. By mapping the musical notes to their corresponding frequencies and applying envelopes, the sound is enhanced for better quality. The program also illustrates the digitally generated signal in the time domain, frequency domain, and spectrogram.

## **Features**
- Digital music generation
- Frequnecy function base on semitone offset
- Time-domain and Frequnecy-domain(FFT) plot
- Spectrogram visualization

## **Requirements**
  - **MATLAB R2020a or later/website version**
