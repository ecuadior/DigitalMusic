# **Digitally Generated Music In MATLAB**

This project genreats music digitally using sine waves to create piano notes. The code recreates the chorus of **Adventure of A lifeTime** by Coldplay. BY mapping the musical notes to their coressponding frequncing and using envlopes to make it soud better. The program also illustrates the digitally genreted singal in time domina, freqynecy domain, and spectorgram.

## **Features**
- Digital music generation
- Frequnecy function base on semitone offset
- Time-domain and Frequnecy-domain(FFT) plot
- Spectrogram visualization

## **Requirements**
  - **MATLAB R2020a or later/website version**

## **Installation**
  1. **Install MATLAB**
